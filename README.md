# VRP_Project
This is a simple demonstration of using ORTOOLS from Google for solving a simple VRP problem. Here you can learn how to call APIs to extract the coordinates for an location and how the routes should be approximately planned based on how many depots and addresses to deliver are added.
#This is an experimental project so more things could be added and for a better performance the code could be editable
 Jupyter Notebook was used to open the Google map to see the routes on.
